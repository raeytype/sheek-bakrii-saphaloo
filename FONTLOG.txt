Sheikh Bakri Sapalo font family
===========================================
The "Athinkra â€“ Sheikh Bakri Sapalo" typeface is derived directly from the "JG Oromo"

All modifications to the original JG Oromo font are detailed in the following:


Version 1.0

* Characters are relocated into the Unicode Private Use Area beginning from
  address range U+E000.

* CALT tables have been added to remap Latin Qubee sequences to Sheik Bakri Sapalo equivalents.

* UPM size scaled from 1000 to 2048.
